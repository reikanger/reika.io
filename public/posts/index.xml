      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a decade, I dedicated myself to Security and Incident Response, working with Mandiant on some of the largest and consequential breaches of corporations and infrastructure. It was a challenging and rewarding career, a front-row seat to the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. I learned a tremendous amount, honed my analytical skills under pressure, and had the privilege of working alongside incredibly talented individuals. I&amp;rsquo;m deeply grateful for the experiences and relationships I forged during that time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
