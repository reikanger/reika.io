# Background

Python and Linux. Gifted a Red Hat installation CD by my uncle.

# Professional Experience

Incident response with Mandiant

# Homelab

In my spare time, I am passionate about homelab work. I use a custom built Intel X99 system as my main server and a DigitalOcean VPS with services on each. To manage my containers, I use Podman, and Nginx serves as my reverse proxy. This setup allows me to experiment with various technologies and maintain a lab platform and useful services for me and my family.

The Nvidia GPU that I moved from my gaming system to the server also enables me to pursue new interests in CUDA, AI, and ML.

# AI and Machine Learning
