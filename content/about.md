![Profile Picture](avatar.jpg)

I am an incident response professional with a Linux, Python, and security background. After graduating with a BS in Management Information Systems from Iowa State University, I started my career in security consulting. My professional work quickly moved to incident response, where I could leverage my skills with Linux and scripting to tackle large log data sets to help respond to adversaries in client networks. Through this work, I realized that my favorite part of incident response is transforming disparate data into a story. I recently returned to school to further pursue and hone my data science skills through the University of Minnesota. I greatly enjoy learning, whether playing a sport, building my home lab, or discovering new technologies. My analytical problem-solving abilities, strengths, and interests across several technical areas make me a valuable addition to any team.

# Background

From a young age, I've enjoyed the challenge of solving problems with technology.  My journey began with a gift from my uncle: a Red Hat Linux installation CD. I enjoyed learning Linux and how operating systems funcitoned, and dove into whatever I could do understand how things worked under the hood. This curiosity then led me to Python, where I discovered the power to automate, analyze, and build my own solutions. Today, I combine my Linux expertise with my Python skills to tackle complex challenges and create efficient, robust systems, and tackle interesting data sets.

# Professional Experience

In my previous roles as a security consultant with PwC and Mandiant (now Google Cloud), I have been responsible for a wide variety of engagements and client infrastructure, which included:
- Managing and auditing a payment processor's Linux and IBM WebSphere environment single-handedly during and after a compromise, and during the resulting Report on Compliance (ROC)
- Acting as the Linux forensics subject matter expert (SME) for the Mandiant IR team, taking a lead investigation role for major cases that featured compromised Linux systems
- Contributing in a lead role for a security research project at Target, which included administering and managing a fleet of non-attributable Linux systems using SaltStack


# Homelab

In my spare time, I am passionate about homelab work. I use a custom built Intel X99 system as my main server and a DigitalOcean VPS with services on each. To manage my containers, I use Podman, and Nginx serves as my reverse proxy. This setup allows me to experiment with various technologies and maintain a lab platform and useful services for me and my family.

The Nvidia GPU that I moved from my gaming system to the server also enables me to pursue new interests in CUDA/AI/ML development and services.

# AI and Machine Learning

I am recently actively pursuing my new interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and recently completed the Data Visualization and Analytics Boot Camp at the University of Minnesota.  This intensive program equipped me with the core skills in data analysis and machine learning to transition into this exciting field.
