For a decade, I dedicated myself to Security and Incident Response, working with Mandiant on some of the largest and consequential breaches of corporations and infrastructure. It was a challenging and rewarding career, a front-row seat to the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. I learned a tremendous amount, honed my analytical skills under pressure, and had the privilege of working alongside incredibly talented individuals. I'm deeply grateful for the experiences and relationships I forged during that time.

While I value the expertise I gained in security, I've felt a growing pull towards a new frontier: building and creating, rather than just reacting. The allure of DevOps, with its focus on automation, efficiency, and collaboration, has become increasingly difficult to ignore.  The potential to streamline processes, improve reliability, and contribute to the development of innovative solutions is incredibly exciting.

Equally captivating is the world of data science and AI/ML development. The ability to extract insights from vast amounts of data, to build models that can predict future outcomes, and to create intelligent systems that can solve complex problems is truly transformative. The potential applications across industries are virtually limitless, and I'm eager to contribute to this rapidly evolving field.

This isn't a sudden decision. Over the past few years, I've been dedicating my spare time to learning and applying new technologies working on personal projects and my infrastructure. I also completed a Data Visualizationa and Analytics Boot Camp. I've been immersing myself in the world of NixOS and Podman/Docker containers, building a foundation for this next chapter.

The journey ahead is uncertain, and I'm embracing the challenge. Whether I ultimately land in DevOps, data science, or AI/ML development, I'm confident that my analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, background, and passion for technology will serve me well. This blog will document my progress, my learnings, and my experiences as I navigate this new beginning.
