# NixOS Homelab

I have migrated all of my personal infrastructure to NixOS, because the declarative design allows me to easily reproduce and manage my systems. Keeping my infrastructure defined in code enables me with automation and self-documentation, which effectively scales my studies and projects.

I host all of my NixOS configurations on GitHub.
